Tracking Coding Activities
=============================
This is a summary reported for nowadays coding activities of the user. <br>
There are 3 graphics inserted in this document to display the detail of the user's activity of each day. The data is collected according to the user's real actions on a computer.

It is clear that this is the first day the tracking tool was taken use. <br>
I downloaded the 'rescuetime' tool to my computer and completed the configuration work. Besides, I worked on coding in eclipse platform and wrote project report on google docs. Because the tool was installed during the daily work, it didn't track all the activities.
Activities on 10/21/2014

This was a busy day. I worked all day on my linux platform and was busy writing code in terminal. However, I didn't realize the impact of dual operating systems and the tracking tool 'rescuetime' was only installed on windows platform. Luckily, I was aware of this problem soon and completed the installation on linux. I worked on a virtual local server editing via node.js and the configuration of npm packages dependencies. Besides, some tech websites were visited because there were several useful information for my coding work. <br>
Activities on 10/22/2014

During Wednesday, I completed the rest of coding work in terminal of previous day. <br>
Activities on 10/24/2014

On Friday, I uploaded all the updated work to github. Because my teammates contributed some part of the project, we have to talk about the corrption and deal with them together. These work was mainly completed on my partner's device, which is the reason why my tracking data is not as full as expected. <br>
<br>
Three Aspects for Improvement
---------------------------
1. One of the main shortage of this tool is the multi-platform performance. It is only a software running on computer, instead of mobile devices, such as mobile phones, tablets and so on. An user might focus on distracting items on mobile devices which is beyond the tracking range. Thus, the activities summary is not as accurate as expected. During these activity figures, my productivity was shown higher than the real situation. <br> 
2. On linux operating system, the tool 'rescuetime' needs to be launched in terminal, instead of auto run after boot up. This is not a good user experience because not each user will remember to launch the software after they restarted the computer. The automation of running is necessary to improve the data collection accuracy and full-coverage. I was slashed in the cross-platform case because of the dual operating system on my computer. It needs more awareness on the cross-platform installation and software configuration. <br>
3. The highest productivity time for me is morning, evening and night. It is obvious that the afternoon is always a period of sleepy time which more distracting games are filled in. During my coding work, much searching and communication work is necessary, which is the feature of a team coding work. <br>
