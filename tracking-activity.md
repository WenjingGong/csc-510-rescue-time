It is clear that this is the first day the tracking tool was taken use. <br>
I downloaded the 'rescuetime' tool to my computer and completed the configuration work. Besides, I worked on coding in eclipse platform and wrote project report on google docs. Because the tool was installed during the daily work, it didn't track all the activities.

This was a busy day. I worked all day on my linux platform and was busy writing code in terminal. However, I didn't realize the impact of dual operating systems and the tracking tool 'rescuetime' was only installed on windows platform. Luckily, I was aware of this problem soon and completed the installation on linux. I worked on a virtual local server editing via node.js and the configuration of npm packages dependencies. Besides, some tech websites were visited because there were several useful information for my coding work. <br>

On Friday, I uploaded all the updated work to github. Because my teammates contributed some part of the project, we have to talk about the corrption and deal with them together. These work was mainly completed on my partner's device, which is the reason why my tracking data is not as full as expected. <br>
